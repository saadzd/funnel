      <p class="card-text">
        You are working on an app used in an expensive robots shop. The existing functionality helps
        us keep track of all the robots we are currently trying to sell, and the staff members who
        are experts in each type of robot. You can only update the name and the price of a robot
        from the UI, but with some skills, you can do a whole lot more.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        We are starting to get a lot of calls from clients interested in our robots, and it's hard
        to keep track of things. We need a new module that allows us to gather information about the
        client's interest, and allocate them to the staff members in a way that maximizes our
        chances of selling all the robots.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        Some clients know exactly what they want, others are just testing the waters. Nevertheless,
        we want our staff members to engage with all of them.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        You need to implement a new page where we can fill in the information gathered from the
        client.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Client information</strong>: name, email, phone number, address, notes</li>
        <li>
          <strong>General interest</strong>: hardware type, brand, autonomy, weight, price range
          <small class="text-muted">
            (e.g. Cleaning robot, RobotFactory, 48 hours, 2 kg, $500 - $1000)
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optional features</strong> that can sometimes make the difference
          <small class="text-muted">(e.g. knows how to dance, makes good breakfast, etc.)</small>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="card-text">
        Upon saving the form, you need to allocate the client to the staff member who has the
        highest chance of finding a robot for them. Use the following rules to find this match. Keep
        in mind that these rules might change quite often as we experiment with different
        approaches.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Pick the staff member who has knowledge in the biggest number of robots that strictly
          match the general requirements of the client
          <small class="text-muted"
            >(e.g. if a robot is cheaper or more expensive than what the client requested, it should
            not be considered as a match)</small
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is a tie between two or more staff members, pick the one staff who has the
          biggest average count of optional features for the matching robots
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is still a tie, pick the one staff who has the biggest average price for the
          matching robots
        </li>
        <li>If there is still a tie, pick at random one of these staff members</li>
